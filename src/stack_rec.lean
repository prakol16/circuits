# Conversion of iteration to recursion using a stack

This file essentially describes how to eliminate recursion into iteration.

## Recursion with an explicit stack

For W-types, we can define a function `stack_rec`,
which is similar to `rec` except that it explicitly keeps track of the
arguments on the stack, rather than allowing the recursive function to return
higher-order (non-encodable) functions.

For example, consider checking for equality of trees: the recursor has type `tree → tree → bool`,
the motive is `tree → bool`, and the inductive step calls the inductive hypotheses,
which are `left : tree → bool` and `right : tree bool` on the current left and right subtrees.

This is an issue, because `tree → bool` is not encodable, and indeed, any total
complexity class (e.g. the primitive recursive functions) cannot interpret itself,
so it is not possible to have the motive be a representation of the "code" for `tree → bool`.

In general, for a W-type with nodes labeled by `α` and children by `β : α → Type`,
we write `stack_rec : W_type β → γ → δ`, defined primarily by
  - `pre : Π x, β x → γ → γ`: "prepares" the arguments to the inductive hypothesis,
    given the current node's children `Π x, β x` and the current argument `γ`
  - `post : (Π x, (β x → δ) → δ) → γ → δ`: computes the result given the inductive
  hypotheses `(β x → δ)` and the current argument `γ`.

TODO: generalize `stack_rec` to all W-types. Tactic to automatically convert structural
recursion where the motive is itself a function to `stack_rec`. This will enable us
to write functions naturally in Lean and then automatically prove that they are primitive recursive,
polynomial time, etc. using a tactic.

/-- Do a single step of the iteration. In particular,
    - If the top of the stack is a result, pop the value before that and plug in the result.
    - If the top of the stack is a tree with the left branch uncomputed, push to the stack the
        arguments for the left branch, unless the tree is `nil`, in which case we directly
        compute the result.
    - If the top of the stack is a tree with the left branch computed, push to the stack the
      arguments for the right branch.
  This halts when the stack contains fewer than 2 elements, or the top 2 elements are both results
